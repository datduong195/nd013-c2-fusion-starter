# SDCND : Sensor Fusion and Tracking
This is the project for the second course in the  [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) : Sensor Fusion and Tracking. 

In this project, you'll fuse measurements from LiDAR and camera and track vehicles over time. You will be using real-world data from the Waymo Open Dataset, detect objects in 3D point clouds and apply an extended Kalman filter for sensor fusion and tracking.

The project consists of two major parts: 
1. **Object detection**: In this part, a deep-learning approach is used to detect vehicles in LiDAR data based on a birds-eye view perspective of the 3D point-cloud. Also, a series of performance measures is used to evaluate the performance of the detection approach. 
2. **Object tracking** : In this part, an extended Kalman filter is used to track vehicles over time, based on the lidar detections fused with camera detections. Data association and track management are implemented as well.

The following diagram contains an outline of the data flow and of the individual steps that make up the algorithm.

Also, the project code contains various tasks, which are detailed step-by-step in the code. More information on the algorithm and on the tasks can be found in the Udacity classroom.

## Installation Instructions for Running Locally
### Cloning the Project
In order to create a local copy of the project, please click on "Code" and then "Download ZIP". Alternatively, you may of-course use GitHub Desktop or Git Bash for this purpose. 

### Python
The project has been written using Python 3.7. Please make sure that your local installation is equal or above this version. 

### Package Requirements
All dependencies required for the project have been listed in the file `requirements.txt`. You may either install them one-by-one using pip or you can use the following command to install them all at once: 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

### Waymo Open Dataset Reader
The Waymo Open Dataset Reader is a very convenient toolbox that allows you to access sequences from the Waymo Open Dataset without the need of installing all of the heavy-weight dependencies that come along with the official toolbox. The installation instructions can be found in `tools/waymo_reader/README.md`. 

### Waymo Open Dataset Files
This project makes use of three different sequences to illustrate the concepts of object detection and tracking. These are: 
- Sequence 1 : `training_segment-1005081002024129653_5313_150_5333_150_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 2 : `training_segment-10072231702153043603_5725_000_5745_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 3 : `training_segment-10963653239323173269_1924_000_1944_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`

To download these files, you will have to register with Waymo Open Dataset first: [Open Dataset â€“ Waymo](https://waymo.com/open/terms), if you have not already, making sure to note "Udacity" as your institution.

Once you have done so, please [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files) to access the Google Cloud Container that holds all the sequences. Once you have been cleared for access by Waymo (which might take up to 48 hours), you can download the individual sequences. 

The sequences listed above can be found in the folder "training". Please download them and put the `tfrecord`-files into the `dataset` folder of this project.


### Pre-Trained Models
The object detection methods used in this project use pre-trained models which have been provided by the original authors. They can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pqx7sShlqKSGmvshTYbNDcUEYyZwfn3A/view?usp=sharing) (darknet) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RcEfUIF1pzDZco8PJkZ10OL-wLL2usEj/view?usp=sharing) (fpn_resnet). Once downloaded, please copy the model files into the paths `/tools/objdet_models/darknet/pretrained` and `/tools/objdet_models/fpn_resnet/pretrained` respectively.

### Using Pre-Computed Results

In the main file `loop_over_dataset.py`, you can choose which steps of the algorithm should be executed. If you want to call a specific function, you simply need to add the corresponding string literal to one of the following lists: 

- `exec_data` : controls the execution of steps related to sensor data. 
  - `pcl_from_rangeimage` transforms the Waymo Open Data range image into a 3D point-cloud
  - `load_image` returns the image of the front camera

- `exec_detection` : controls which steps of model-based 3D object detection are performed
  - `bev_from_pcl` transforms the point-cloud into a fixed-size birds-eye view perspective
  - `detect_objects` executes the actual detection and returns a set of objects (only vehicles) 
  - `validate_object_labels` decides which ground-truth labels should be considered (e.g. based on difficulty or visibility)
  - `measure_detection_performance` contains methods to evaluate detection performance for a single frame

In case you do not include a specific step into the list, pre-computed binary files will be loaded instead. This enables you to run the algorithm and look at the results even without having implemented anything yet. The pre-computed results for the mid-term project need to be loaded using [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-s46dKSrtx8rrNwnObGbly2nO3i4D7r7?usp=sharing) link. Please use the folder `darknet` first. Unzip the file within and put its content into the folder `results`.

- `exec_tracking` : controls the execution of the object tracking algorithm

- `exec_visualization` : controls the visualization of results
  - `show_range_image` displays two LiDAR range image channels (range and intensity)
  - `show_labels_in_image` projects ground-truth boxes into the front camera image
  - `show_objects_and_labels_in_bev` projects detected objects and label boxes into the birds-eye view
  - `show_objects_in_bev_labels_in_camera` displays a stacked view with labels inside the camera image on top and the birds-eye view with detected objects on the bottom
  - `show_tracks` displays the tracking results
  - `show_detection_performance` displays the performance evaluation based on all detected 
  - `make_tracking_movie` renders an output movie of the object tracking results

Even without solving any of the tasks, the project code can be executed. 

The final project uses pre-computed lidar detections in order for all students to have the same input data. If you use the workspace, the data is prepared there already. Otherwise, [download the pre-computed lidar detections](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IkqFGYTF6Fh_d8J3UjQOSNJ2V42UDZpO?usp=sharing) (~1 GB), unzip them and put them in the folder `results`.

### Project Overview
This is Udacity Self Driving Nanodegree second course 3D Object Detection Midterm Project.
## 3D Object Detection
As in the previous course, Waymo Open Dataset will be used for this project. The Dataset contains data collected in real world and LiDAR cloud points will be used for 3D object detection.
Dataset can be found here: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files
There are requirements to achieve these goals:
1. Converting dataset ranges channel to 8bit to visualize range and intensity image
2. Create Bird Eye View (BEV) perspective for the points cloud which then lidar intensity values and normalized height values are applied to each BEV frame
3. For 3d object detection, Complex Yolo(https://paperswithcode.com/paper/complex-yolo-real-time-3d-object-detection-on) and Super Fast and Accurate 3D Object Detection based on 3D LiDAR Point Clouds (https://github.com/maudzung/SFA3D) will be considered in the excersise to configure and initiate the model for Vehicles detections. Then applying Bounding Box and Polygon for each detected object
4. Using pretrained data in tfrecords format files, calculate the Intersection over Union (IoU) with required minimum threshold, True/False Positive/Negative detections, Precision and Recall values.

To use the project: execute file "python loop_over_dataset.py" with python3.

## Step 1: Compute LiDar cloud points from Range Image
# ID_S1_EX1: 
This task requires a preview of provided range images then convert range and intensity channel to 8bit format. Then using OpenCV to stack vertically and visualize  them in a single image, cropped it to +/- 90 degree to the foward x-axis. The implementation of function is done in "objdet_pcl.py"
```
# visualize range image
def show_range_image(frame, lidar_name)
```
To test for this function, in "python loop_over_dataset.py" , config as follow:
```
exec_detection = [] # options are 'bev_from_pcl', 'detect_objects', 'validate_object_labels', 'measure_detection_performance'; options not in the list will be loaded from file
exec_tracking = [] # options are 'perform_tracking'
exec_visualization = ['show_range_image'] # options are 'show_range_image', 'show_bev', 'show_pcl', 'show_labels_in_image', 'show_objects_and_labels_in_bev', 'show_objects_in_bev_labels_in_camera', 'show_tracks', 'show_detection_performance', 'make_tracking_movie'
```
Here is the result:

From the results, objects like cars, traffic lights, trees  or buildings can be found. These objects are detected over intensity channel, so most of the time cars on the road are clearly be seen with rear and front directions. This will be very helpful in later task when applying object detection into these images.

## Step-2: Creaate BEV from Lidar PCL
In this step requires:
1. Converting the coordinates to pixel values
2. Assigning lidar intensity values to BEV mapping
3. Using sorted point cloud lidar from the previous task
4. Normalizing the height map in the BEV
5. Compute and map the intensity values
The implementation of function is done in "objdet_pcl.py"
```
# create birds-eye view of lidar data
def bev_from_pcl(lidar_pcl, configs):
```
To test for this function, in "python loop_over_dataset.py" , config as follow:
```
exec_detection = ['bev_from_pcl'] # options are 'bev_from_pcl', 'detect_objects', 'validate_object_labels', 'measure_detection_performance'; options not in the list will be loaded from file
exec_tracking = [] # options are 'perform_tracking'
exec_visualization = [] # options are 'show_range_image', 'show_bev', 'show_pcl', 'show_labels_in_image', 'show_objects_and_labels_in_bev', 'show_objects_in_bev_labels_in_camera', 'show_tracks', 'show_detection_performance', 'make_tracking_movie'

## Step-3: Model Based Object Detection in BEV Image
In this step, SFA3D model will be configured and initialized with a pretrained data to perform vehicle detections and apply bounding boxes and 3D polygons. Futher exploration to use this model can be found here: https://github.com/maudzung/SFA3D
1. Instantiating the FPN resnet model from the cloned repository configs
2. Extracting 3d bounding boxes from the responses
3. Transforming the pixel to vehicle coordinates
4. Model output tuned to the bounding box format [class-id, x, y, z, h, w, l, yaw]
The implementation of function is done in "objdet_detect.py"
```
# load model-related parameters into an edict
def load_configs_model(model_name='darknet', configs=None)

# create model according to selected model type
def create_model(configs)

# detect trained objects in birds-eye view
def detect_objects(input_bev_maps, model, configs)

```
To test for this function, in "python loop_over_dataset.py" , config as follow:
```
exec_detection = ['bev_from_pcl', 'detect_objects'] # options are 'bev_from_pcl', 'detect_objects', 'validate_object_labels', 'measure_detection_performance'; options not in the list will be loaded from file
exec_tracking = [] # options are 'perform_tracking'

```
Here are results:
